## Project Introduction

Have you ever wondered whether or not you snore? <br>
Snore Detector detects your snoring when you sleep and it records it automatically, <br>
so when you wake up, you can actually hear your snoring!

## 구현 기능

### Snore Classification
- Trained createML model with snoring dataset from kaggle
- Notifies snore when accuracy is over 90%

### Snore Recorder
- When the ML model tells if you snore, the recorder starts recording the sound for 10 seconds
- When you wake up, you can listen to the recorded sound

## 배운 점 & 아쉬운 점

<p align="justify">
- There were lot more things I was planning on developing, but it was too short to actually work on it <br>
- I wanted to learn how createML works, but there weren't documentations about the algorithm
</p>
